# [Market Basket Analysis](https://rpubs.com/askovron/mba-associationrules)

- The dataset has 38765 rows of the purchase orders of people from the grocery stores
- The work uses **unsupervised learning method based on association rules: Apriori Algorithm**
- This method might be helpful to estimate the behaviour of a client who does the shopping, by estimating, which other products the customer is going to select, basing on his current products in basket.
- In order to obtain the highest possible results, four metrics need to be maximised: support, confidence, expected confidence, lift
- Jaccard index was calculated in order to obtain probability that some two products will be bought together
- R software was used for data mining, engineering and modelling. For more details, I invite you to visit the full project description, published on [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/askovron/mba-associationrules)
